Thus, if it's not extremely obvious what changed, we should have some lasting indication of what just changed after a screen refresh. For instance, a column next to line numbering with a \"*\" on the lines that just changed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This is a more general principle, but newbies aren't familiar with the exact behaviour of the program, so anything that's surprising (which could basically be anything) should be conveyed for a sec or two after it happens. I'm pretty sure this is why animation exist on LCD-screen UIs (e.g. a screen minimizes without warning and even though you weren't looking at it, the motion draws your eye after half a second and the 1-second animation means you still have half a second of watching the animation to understand it's moved to the taskbar).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Refreshing = you're blind for a couple of seconds and can't navigate or check stuff = sucks and should be minimized as much as possible. As in, minimize the number of partial refreshes and also avoid full-refreshes when a partial refresh would do. A few ideas for how to counter this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>a) if you're editing a line with text after the cursor, then instead of constantly reflowing the entire paragraph, perhaps either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>i) overlay the edit until the user stops  typing and then reflow the entire thing just once</li>\n<li>ii) put the typing into a separate blank spot on screen then put an arrow to indicate where the text will be placed (perhaps if we have a full line's worth of vertical empty space between lines,  we can just have the typing displayed between the lines below with a ^.), or</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>b) if you're adding to a line and you need more space from the paragraph below you, perhaps a partial refresh could simply shrink the one paragraph below without needing to shrink any paragraphs <em>below the below</em>. Obviously, un-shrink the paragraph after a full reflow.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>c) if you're deleting text, just use a strikethrough temporarily, perhaps? This might be an unnecessary delay that merely damages the immediacy of the action, especially if you've already highlighted the section. Worth testing idk.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Following on from 3 and 4b, if a <em>lot</em> of stuff moved around on the screen, then it would be helpful to explain what went where. Especially if your reflow involves both unshrinking a paragraph and reflowing the text below it. Ideas for making a full-screen refresh/reflow clearer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a) Similar to the \"asterisk column\" idea from point 2, perhaps a line for each paragraph that moved going from where it was <em>before</em> the refresh to where it is <em>after</em>. Obviously we'd need to do a bunch of texting (with yet another effing text editor, because clearly the world needs more of those lol)</li>\n<li>b) Perhaps make a full reflow a manual action bound to a button. This completely removes the chance of a \"surprise refresh\".</li>\n<li>c) Instead of refreshing the whole screen at once, maybe refresh each 'step' individually so maybe it's clearer? As in, either:\n<ul>\n<li>i) refresh each e.g. 20% of the screen (split horizontal into bundles of lines)  one at a time, from top to bottom\n<ul>\n<li>^here see partial refresh of eink screens</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>ii) do each logical reflow action separately - so, do a strikethrough then another strikethrough then unshrink a paragraph etc etc in the order the user right did it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>d) Maybe show a \"minimap\" of what a whole-screen reflow would look like, before it refreshes? As in, have a permanent minimap that updates more-or-less immediately. Would work well with the \"manual refresh\"  and the 5a.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"title":""}},"workingGroup":{"workingGroupPages":[{"fileName":"index","path":"/groups/psychology-and-ux/","workingGroupName":"Psychology and UX","markdownRemark":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Untitled"}}},{"fileName":"template","path":"/groups/psychology-and-ux/template/","workingGroupName":"Psychology and UX","markdownRemark":{"frontmatter":{"title":""}}},{"fileName":"index","path":"/groups/psychology-and-ux/","workingGroupName":"Psychology and UX","markdownRemark":{"frontmatter":{"title":""}}},{"fileName":"index","path":"/groups/psychology-and-ux/","workingGroupName":"Psychology and UX","markdownRemark":{"frontmatter":{"title":""}}},{"fileName":"overview","path":"/groups/psychology-and-ux/overview/","workingGroupName":"Psychology and UX","markdownRemark":{"frontmatter":{"title":""}}},{"fileName":"general","path":"/groups/psychology-and-ux/general/","workingGroupName":"Psychology and UX","markdownRemark":{"frontmatter":{"title":""}}},{"fileName":"deep-os","path":"/groups/psychology-and-ux/deep-os/","workingGroupName":"Psychology and UX","markdownRemark":{"frontmatter":{"title":""}}},{"fileName":"einkux-highlvloverview","path":"/groups/psychology-and-ux/einkux-highlvloverview/","workingGroupName":"Psychology and UX","markdownRemark":{"frontmatter":{"title":""}}},{"fileName":"text-editor","path":"/groups/psychology-and-ux/text-editor/","workingGroupName":"Psychology and UX","markdownRemark":{"frontmatter":{"title":""}}}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"adfcb020-89bf-58e0-a502-7b5c64859773","workingGroupName":"Psychology and UX","fileName":"text-editor","__params":{"workingGroupName":"psychology-and-ux","fileName":"text-editor"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2744905544"]}
